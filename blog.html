				<h2>Assignment #1 - 9/30/24</h2>
              	<p> No issues coding the assignment, I have so much code from previous assignments that I was able to relearn some stuff I use to use alot. I didn't use that much resources besides looking at my repository from 2022. </p>

				<h2>Assignment #2 - 10/14/24</h2>
              	<p> Some formating stuff was rough to work with. CSS wasn't my favorite to work with but we somehow managed? Everything but getting my flexbox spacing to let me have more spaces if given space. Only two and it is very confusing to me. I think that HTML and Javascript can come easier to me because I can see what stuff is suppose to do but wiht CSS I am a bit blind to it all.</p>

				<h2>Assignment #3 - 11/11/24</h2>
              	<p> I love dealing with Javascript instead of CSS because I can see my code and understand what it wants to do for once. I also have a friend at UW who took his Web Dev class last spring so it was useful to talk to him about what I need to do for code. </p>

	      <h2>Assignment #5 - 12/2/24</h2>
              	<p> I think I lost a piece of my soul working on this. Like getting the server to launch was my issue. I figured it out on hosting a local server but I don't think I got handlebars working. I'm just happy that the website loaded when I opened it up. I think I have a good idea of how everything works but I don't think I got this working as intended. Locally hosted works for now I guess </p>
