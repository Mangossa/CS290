  <h3> Q: What is the most complicated thing you've done with web development skills?</h3>
  <p><b>A:</b> I took a web development class in my senior year of high school in a dual enrollement class, but the credit didn't transfer over. My final project was essentially making a portfolio website for myself. I always think I can do better but I need to make stuff for the portfolio and improve on my web dev knowledge. This class should just be me canabalizing my old code to remember everything. I just need to remember how to launch websites because I'm trying to see what my old stuff looked like.</p>
  <h3> Q: What do I hope to learn in this class?</h3>
  <p><b>A:</b> Besides for generally getting better with Web Dev to try and make that actual portfolio website, I want struggled quite a bit with javascript the last time I took the class. Maybe I've improved since the two years ago but we shall find out.</p>
  <h3>Q: Have you signed up for the course campuswire forum?</h3>
  <p><b>A:</b> Good question? I'm struggling to figure out where everything in this class is but if I can find it I will make sure I join it.</p>
  <h3> Q: Interesting Fact/Experience?</h3>
  <p><b>A:</b> I guess I went with our WBB team to Las Vegas and New York for March Madness and tournaments. I went with the band for the trips as I am not a woman or a basketball player. Or good at basketball for that matter. I was just along for the vibes and fun.</p>
